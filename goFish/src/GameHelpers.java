If you're opponent has the card, you take it from them to make a pair.\n If your opponent asks you for a card, you give it to them to make a pair. If either players don't have the requested card, you 'go fish' and draw a card from the deck. You are only required to guess the rank of the card (ace, number, or queen/king/jack), suit is not required.");
